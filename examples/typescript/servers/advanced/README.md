# x402 Advanced Resource Server Example

This is an advanced example of an Express.js server that demonstrates how to implement paywall functionality without using middleware. This approach is useful for more complex scenarios, such as:

- Asynchronous payment settlement
- Custom payment validation logic
- Complex routing requirements
- Integration with existing authentication systems

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v20+ (install via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- pnpm v10 (install via [pnpm.io/installation](https://pnpm.io/installation))
- A valid Ethereum address for receiving payments

## Setup

1. Copy `.env-local` to `.env` and add your Ethereum address:

```bash
cp .env-local .env
```

2. Install and build all packages from the typescript examples root:
```bash
cd ../../
pnpm install
pnpm build
cd servers/advanced
```

3. Run the server
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Implementation Overview

This advanced implementation provides a structured approach to handling payments with:

1. Helper functions for creating payment requirements and verifying payments
2. Support for both synchronous and asynchronous payment settlement
3. Proper error handling and response formatting
4. Integration with the x402 facilitator service

> **Note**: The synchronous and asynchronous examples are provided for comparison purposes only. If you only need synchronous payment processing, we highly recommend using the middleware approach instead, as it provides a simpler and more maintainable solution.

## Testing the Server

You can test the server using one of the example clients:

### Using the Fetch Client
```bash
cd ../../clients/fetch
# Ensure .env is setup
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Using the Axios Client
```bash
cd ../../clients/axios
# Ensure .env is setup
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Example Endpoints

The server includes example endpoints that demonstrate different payment scenarios:

### Synchronous Payment (For Comparison Only)
- `/weather` - Requires immediate payment of $0.001 to access
- Returns a simple weather report
- Payment is verified and settled before returning the response

### Asynchronous Payment (Advanced Use Cases)
- `/async-weather` - Supports delayed payment settlement
- Returns the weather data immediately
- Processes payment asynchronously in the background

## Response Format

### Payment Required (402)
```json
{
  "x402Version": 1,
  "error": "X-PAYMENT header is required",
  "accepts": [
    {
      "scheme": "exact",
      "network": "base-sepolia",
      "maxAmountRequired": "1000",
      "resource": "http://localhost:3001/weather",
      "description": "Access to weather data",
      "mimeType": "",
      "payTo": "0xYourAddress",
      "maxTimeoutSeconds": 60,
      "asset": "0x...",
      "outputSchema": null,
      "extra": {
        "name": "USD Coin",
        "version": "1"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Successful Response
```json
// Body
{
  "report": {
    "weather": "sunny",
    "temperature": 70
  }
}
// Headers
{
  "X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE": "..." // Encoded response object
}
```

## Extending the Example

To add more paid endpoints with asynchronous payment processing, you can follow this pattern:

```typescript
app.get("/your-endpoint", async (req, res) => {
  const resource = `${req.protocol}://${req.headers.host}${req.originalUrl}` as Resource;
  const paymentRequirements = createPaymentRequirements(
    "$0.001", // Your price
    "base-sepolia", // Your network
    resource,
    "Description of your resource"
  );

  const isValid = await verifyPayment(req, res, paymentRequirements);
  if (!isValid) return;

  // Return your protected resource immediately
  res.json({
    // Your response data
  });

  // Process payment asynchronously
  try {
    const settleResponse = await settle(
      exact.evm.decodePayment(req.header("X-PAYMENT")!),
      paymentRequirements[0]
    );
    const responseHeader = settleResponseHeader(settleResponse);
    // In a real application, you would store this response header
    // and associate it with the payment for later verification
    console.log("Payment settled:", responseHeader);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Payment settlement failed:", error);
    // In a real application, you would handle the failed payment
    // by marking it for retry or notifying the user
  }
});
```
